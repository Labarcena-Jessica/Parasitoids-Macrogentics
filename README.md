# Parasitoids
Using the largest georeferenced molecular dataset downloaded from BOLD, we used a macrogenetics approach to explore the spatial relationship between intra- and interspecific levels of diversity and potential environmental variables influencing the anomalous diversity pattern in parasitoid wasps. 
We downloaded the data using the Barcode Of Life Data System (BOLD) 45 API (Application-Platform Interface) directly into R 46 on October 19, 2021. The combined data set for Ichneumonidae and Braconidae consisted of 243,870 sequences of the 5â€™ region of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (co1-5P), the most common barcode gene for animals.
The scripts include data cleaning, filtering and quality control, and nucleotide diversity analysis at three geographical levels: grid cells, latitudinal bands and climatic zones. It also includes an estimation of species richness at the cell level and a model averaging approach to explore data environmental correlates of the atypical latitudinal diversity gradient.
